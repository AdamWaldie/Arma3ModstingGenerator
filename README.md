This script allows arma 3 preset exports from the launcher to be turned into ID strings for workshop downloads. if you set up your server to save the mod folder as the workshop ID of the mod, you can also use this tool to generate a mod load order comptabale with that setup for quick, repeatable access. This stops the random folder rename bullshit commonly associated with A3 modding.

Ive also Added an example bat for how you might handle downloading workshop items and saving them under their own IDs in your mod folder.
